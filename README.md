i learn some of these codes from youtube, so some of the credits is not all mine. A* and other algorithms are fun to learn, i express my gratitude to all person who helps me to code, including that guy on youtube and my teachers:) 
You can edit the grid size as much as you want, however i recommend to only use 50x50. and remember to execute the code in main.py:)
